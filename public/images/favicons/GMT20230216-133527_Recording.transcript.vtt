1
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.380
Piyush Garg: As I was saying, we learn about styles, themes, and

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.800
creating customer use.

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.560
Piyush Garg: I've created a new project, and once the spirits we look at how to work on themes and styles.

4
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.070
Piyush Garg: Okay.

5
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.440
Piyush Garg: So your device will be running on. Your application would be running on so many multiple devices, and

6
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.210
Piyush Garg: each has its own display density, as we all know.

7
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.060
Piyush Garg: but

8
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:37.200
Piyush Garg: you also want to use your views across different screens on your app, and this should be consistency, so that your user does not feel very disoriented when he goes from one screen to another. 2 thirds.

9
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:48.980
Piyush Garg: right? So basically styles and themes help you to beautify your app, but also unify the experience that your user gets when you when they are using the application.

10
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:59.270
Piyush Garg: Okay, so what i'm going to do here is create a simple view which has many text views, and then i'll show you how to apply styles on those text to

11
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.280
Piyush Garg: okay.

12
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.510
Piyush Garg: we're going to create. We have this layout here.

13
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.740
Piyush Garg: Transfer text view. Let's move this

14
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.230
Piyush Garg: to the top of the screen.

15
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.510
Piyush Garg: This.

16
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.860
Piyush Garg: So I created 6 text views. Yes, and i'll put them one below the other.

17
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.430
Piyush Garg: Let's see, this is first type of reading that we' about

18
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.280
Piyush Garg: see you.

19
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.230
Piyush Garg: Okay. So I have these 6 text views. And

20
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:41.400
Piyush Garg: basically we heading one heading to all these would be the main headings of your app like wherever you use text views throughout your app.

21
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.420
Some headings could be like whatever comes under the.

22
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.010
Piyush Garg: and then these would be the body views. Okay.

23
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.870
Piyush Garg: So let's give give styling to each of these posts.

24
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.800
Piyush Garg: So by styling, I mean X size textile.

25
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.540
Piyush Garg: Right? So let me set that up here

26
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.230
Piyush Garg: its size.

27
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.320
Piyush Garg: So this is heading right, so it will be wake

28
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.800
Piyush Garg: and hold like style.

29
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.890
Piyush Garg: This is heading of type 2. So this would be

30
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.060
Piyush Garg: smaller than that.

31
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.290
Piyush Garg: I would still be bored.

32
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.850
Piyush Garg: Sorry

33
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.750
Piyush Garg: or

34
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.060
Piyush Garg: okay. This is sub hitting

35
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.350
Piyush Garg: so smaller than trading size. 2, hey?

36
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.520
Piyush Garg: So it's 34. I speak

37
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.440
Piyush Garg: not, for

38
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.730
Piyush Garg: it could be both. No sure

39
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.690
Piyush Garg: pitched sites

40
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.810
Piyush Garg: good.

41
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.620
Piyush Garg: and then body would be 16 sp size.

42
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.030
Piyush Garg: But I will make the second body right.

43
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.630
Italy.

44
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.670
Piyush Garg: Oh, yeah.

45
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.160
So

46
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:17.500
Piyush Garg: okay. So these are different types of style that usually exist in a document, right? If you read through a book you will see headings of of different sizes, some headings under them

47
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.360
Piyush Garg: right, and then body, some with italics and some regular

48
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.970
Piyush Garg: right. So

49
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:30.560
Piyush Garg: I created those styles here. But see, I have to type all the rest multiple times right.

50
00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:39.080
Piyush Garg: All these things i'm having these multiple times right? So there should be a way that I can combine it int0 0ne

51
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.260
place, and then use that

52
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.030
Piyush Garg: reference in the text view instead. Right? So that's exactly what styles to.

53
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.920
Piyush Garg: So I create a new xml file here.

54
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:02.000
Piyush Garg: and then we'll give a for each of these

55
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.420
Piyush Garg: your style.

56
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.800
Piyush Garg: You're being one alright.

57
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.710
Piyush Garg: I you.

58
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.790
Piyush Garg: So, heading one.

59
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:25.120
Piyush Garg: I can move most of these things out of here. Okay, except for constraints. Let's move everything else out from here.

60
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.620
Piyush Garg: the stream text. And Id So Yes.

61
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.320
Piyush Garg: right.

62
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.160
Piyush Garg: Okay. So we will have to do the same thing for these.

63
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.180
Piyush Garg: Okay?

64
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:17.880
Piyush Garg: Okay. So now that I've moved all these things here. I can reference this

65
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.870
Piyush Garg: style directly in my

66
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.400
Piyush Garg: textbook here. Okay. So it's time.

67
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.420
Piyush Garg: I think, starting one.

68
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.390
Piyush Garg: So that would result in the exact same. Ui.

69
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.340
Piyush Garg: Okay.

70
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.720
Piyush Garg: we do the same thing with all the other views.

71
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.970
Piyush Garg: so that this file is click. Okay.

72
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.600
Piyush Garg: adding 2 is just 28 Sp: Everything else is same.

73
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.200
Piyush Garg: heading, one

74
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.590
Piyush Garg: submitting one. it's really

75
00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.000
Piyush Garg: over Sp.

76
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.950
Piyush Garg: And not both.

77
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.800
Piyush Garg: So I'm. Heading to it's also not old, and for dsp

78
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.490
Piyush Garg: body style one

79
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.200
Piyush Garg: is it?

80
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.840
And

81
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:08.450
Piyush Garg: this one is with 16 at the speed

82
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.480
Piyush Garg: great.

83
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.940
Piyush Garg: So let's use all these teams in our layout.

84
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.860
Piyush Garg: So

85
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.050
Piyush Garg: right?

86
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:37.770
Okay.

87
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.180
Piyush Garg: right.

88
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.950
Piyush Garg: So now this file is very clean and does not have repetitive data.

89
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.090
Piyush Garg: And all those styles are here.

90
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.510
Piyush Garg: Okay. So if I change anything in one of these parameters

91
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.300
Piyush Garg: it will change here as Well, okay.

92
00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.980
Piyush Garg: but wait. Now I have repetitive stuff. Here

93
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.730
Piyush Garg: I am. Do something so that things Don't repeat.

94
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.660
Piyush Garg: Here. Let's try that. Okay. So

95
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.970
Piyush Garg: things that are repeating. In all the places here are

96
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:07.070
Piyush Garg: layout height. Lay out with and lay out margin, which is same for everything

97
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:11.960
Piyush Garg: right. So in this case I can create a base style.

98
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.300
Piyush Garg: It's the

99
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.780
Piyush Garg: which will have this

100
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.080
Piyush Garg: it.

101
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.670
Piyush Garg: And then I can inherit this based style.

102
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.890
Piyush Garg: So all these heading styles all right.

103
00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.050
Piyush Garg: So you can inherit an xml component int0 0ne another.

104
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.800
Piyush Garg: So we can do Parent.

105
00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:02.730
Piyush Garg: please. Thank you. Okay. And let's do that for all these.

106
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.290
Piyush Garg: Okay.

107
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:58.510
Piyush Garg: so that cleans up this file as well, with very less repetitive content here as well.

108
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:07.839
Piyush Garg: Right so now, if you go and take a look at your Ui, it will remain the exact same. But we are now using styling instead of

109
00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.690
Piyush Garg: adding all that information at each of these views. Okay.

110
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.260
Piyush Garg: And if I want to change, say there's spacing between these.

111
00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.589
Piyush Garg: Then all I have to do is change it at this one location.

112
00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:26.690
Piyush Garg: and every thing will be updated in the blue.

113
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:27.720
Piyush Garg: Okay.

114
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.650
Piyush Garg: so that saves like it makes it makes the code maintainable. All right.

115
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.590
yeah.

116
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.330
Piyush Garg: let's go back. And

117
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:49.880
Piyush Garg: between these there is still repetitive content of big state.

118
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.440
Piyush Garg: right. So like

119
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.060
Piyush Garg: another step here, please

120
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.100
Piyush Garg: heading study.

121
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.720
Piyush Garg: which will have a parent of this fixed view style.

122
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.230
And

123
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.460
Piyush Garg: yeah.

124
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:20.390
Piyush Garg: And instead of inheriting the base text, we use time here, we will inherit the base heading step.

125
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.060
Piyush Garg: Okay.

126
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:40.780
Piyush Garg: Sub heading has unique parameters. So we cannot do anything here between the body style. We can have

127
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.460
Piyush Garg: this as a piece party style instead of body, one style.

128
00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:57.550
Piyush Garg: and it's me face and headache based 40 style. Then I don't need exercise here.

129
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.750
Piyush Garg: Okay, S0 0 repeting content here.

130
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.330
Piyush Garg: and nothing repeating, Here, I, Sam.

131
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.220
Piyush Garg: this does not exist. This will Green Face.

132
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.550
Piyush Garg: Why do you start you?

133
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.860
Piyush Garg: This would be me.

134
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.100
Piyush Garg: Hey. you guys follow.

135
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.820
Piyush Garg: Hello.

136
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.860
Piyush Garg: Okay.

137
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.350
Piyush Garg: So this is basically how styles will work. Okay.

138
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.140
Piyush Garg: we plan on this application.

139
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:03.760
See?

140
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.490
Piyush Garg: It's basically the same. You I make sure.

141
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:16.740
Piyush Garg: but i'm going to create some more layouts, and then we can navigate between the layout so that we can see how things work.

142
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.450
Piyush Garg: It's taking a lot of time to load the emulator. Just 2 more minutes. Okay.

143
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.240
Piyush Garg: Okay.

144
00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:07.760
Piyush Garg: So let's create a few activities and let's navigate between those active things. Okay.

145
00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.500
Piyush Garg: but we did 2 activities like, let me add a button

146
00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.350
Piyush Garg: with the secret left of people and the first one.

147
00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.670
Piyush Garg: so we can use the same theme here as well.

148
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.390
Piyush Garg: I'm going to add style

149
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.570
Piyush Garg: and use the heading, one side being boosted.

150
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.150
I mean

151
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.220
Piyush Garg: next.

152
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.020
Jason Tse: Okay.

153
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:10.260
Piyush Garg: Yeah.

154
00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.530
Piyush Garg: So by using the style, I don't even have to type everything again right?

155
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:23.300
Piyush Garg: That makes developing the application much more quicker. And you have so many views.

156
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.590
Piyush Garg: I see

157
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.030
Piyush Garg: it's.

158
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:48.820
Yes, but

159
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.960
Piyush Garg: okay. I hope

160
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:37.990
Piyush Garg: we activities. I'm. going to write a code real quick to navigate between these 3 activities.

161
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:45.240
Piyush Garg: Yeah.

162
00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.480
Piyush Garg: And let's create a third activity.

163
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.960
Rushelle Phillips: Yeah, legally.

164
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.390
Rushelle Phillips: So so Exactly.

165
00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.320
Piyush Garg: Yes.

166
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:30.230
Piyush Garg: hello.

167
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.050
Piyush Garg: Okay. So I have 3 activities. I'm.

168
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.380
So

169
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:51.110
Piyush Garg: just going to run this code real quick so that we can see the navigation. Yeah.

170
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.000
Piyush Garg: actually, let me add a button here as well

171
00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.820
Piyush Garg: from where we can go back to the first.

172
00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.920
Piyush Garg: Okay, so I've created the 3 activities. We'll go from first to second, second to third, and

173
00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.570
Piyush Garg: then back from third to first activity. Okay.

174
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:05.080
Piyush Garg: So this is the second activity. and this is the third activity. So we go back to the first activity from here.

175
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:12.850
Piyush Garg: What if I want to give different schemes, color schemes, and different look and feel to each of these screen screens.

176
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:28.870
Piyush Garg: Okay, you would either have to go to the layout and give background colors and everything. But there are these bars as well, right? The action bar. There is a status bar. There is this navigation bar. You'll have to give color to all these.

177
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:34.280
Piyush Garg: Okay. and here like for this button I'm: using.

178
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:48.060
Piyush Garg: I'm not giving a default color. So it's taking this as the default, right? So we want to change everything that look of the entire activity. You can do that using teams. Okay, so we have this

179
00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:56.800
Piyush Garg: 5 year the Xml 5 teams. You will have to configure your theme here. Okay. So let's add a couple more themes.

180
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.180
Piyush Garg: It's perfect.

181
00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:18.870
Piyush Garg: Okay?

182
00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:39.260
Piyush Garg: Oh, that should.

183
00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.710
Piyush Garg: And one more we started.

184
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.060
Piyush Garg: Let's see.

185
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:07.870
Piyush Garg: Let's define some colors here. so

186
00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.830
Piyush Garg: about 300.

187
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:37.470
Piyush Garg: So we have these. Sorry about the background. Nice they are, all those

188
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.130
I'd like to. It's okay. That text.

189
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:50.960
Piyush Garg: They

190
00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:51.950
all the other

191
00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.120
I see.

192
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:57.410
Piyush Garg: Thanks.

193
00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.280
500

194
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.440
Piyush Garg: right on or in should be okay. So

195
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.620
Piyush Garg: the chief. the same.

196
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:47.460
Piyush Garg: We don't need secondary colors because we don't have anything else on that

197
00:40:50.070 --> 00:41:01.010
Piyush Garg: on that layout. So basically these secondary colors would help you fill the edit text and show their circulars. And if you have a pointer it will show the pointer color and all those things. Okay.

198
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:07.170
Piyush Garg: So we don't have any other elements. So I won't one with the second regulars just now.

199
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.300
Piyush Garg: But we can change the

200
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.440
Piyush Garg: let's do

201
00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.740
Piyush Garg: it. Is

202
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.580
Piyush Garg: I remember.

203
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.700
Okay.

204
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:53.590
Piyush Garg: i'm going to copy this and change the colors for the 30

205
00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.310
Piyush Garg: 500

206
00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:13.680
Piyush Garg: bye.

207
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:15.420
Piyush Garg: Oh.

208
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.150
Piyush Garg: no! This primary agreement

209
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.280
Piyush Garg: to take the primary variant from here.

210
00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.320
Piyush Garg: S0 0nce we have the team. we can go to the manifest file

211
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.980
Piyush Garg: and give a theme here. Okay.

212
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:21.680
Piyush Garg: this wasn't already has the correct team. I don't know what to change at this.

213
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:22.520
Piyush Garg: You do.

214
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:06.650
Piyush Garg: So let's run this code now and see what happens. What's the difference?

215
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:07.530
Piyush Garg: Okay.

216
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:39.910
Piyush Garg: Okay. So the first activity is in the original team. I click. Next.

217
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.070
The second activity will be in the orange color scheme. Everything changes. I did not change the color of the button.

218
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:52.730
Piyush Garg: but it changed that by default, right? And if I click this again, the third theme would be in yellow color.

219
00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:59.440
Piyush Garg: Right? So this is how you give them to your application. Okay.

220
00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.600
Piyush Garg: Did you guys follow?

221
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:09.730
Yes.

222
00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.320
Piyush Garg: any questions.

223
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.350
Okay?

224
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.430
Piyush Garg: Okay.

225
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:31.830
Piyush Garg: So just like you did with your styles. You can also inherit your themes. Okay, right now, we are inheriting the

226
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:38.780
Piyush Garg: original theme that comes with Android. But you can also define a base team and then inherit that.

227
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.960
Piyush Garg: Okay? And every team needs to have a variety of things.

228
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.470
Piyush Garg: All right.

229
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:51.460
Piyush Garg: So

230
00:45:54.010 --> 00:46:02.010
Piyush Garg: okay. if you guys follow styles and theme, we'll go to the next topic. Otherwise, let me know if you guys have any question.

231
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.130
Piyush Garg: Hello.

232
00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.850
Piyush Garg: Okay. So

233
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:17.010
we saw how to customize the

234
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:27.660
Piyush Garg: colors and schemes of your app, right? But you can also customize the views, the text view, edit text and all those things. Okay.

235
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:45.640
Piyush Garg: So i'm going to show you how to do that for that. We'll have to inherit the text, view the layouts and all those. Okay. So let's create a view on this screen itself. We'll create a view which is a text view, but

236
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:47.770
Piyush Garg: it's customized to show.

237
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.350
Let's say, cost

238
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:51.960
Piyush Garg: or time.

239
00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:59.360
Piyush Garg: Let's keep cost for now, because we'll have to add something for that. Okay, so i'm going to create a new file.

240
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.670
Piyush Garg: It is a price

241
00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:13.410
Piyush Garg: which will show the cost of the item. and this one in headache and text. Actually, you need to.

242
00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:20.010
Piyush Garg: And this needs context that we would set and

243
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:30.170
Piyush Garg: 6

244
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.740
right.

245
00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.490
Piyush Garg: What else did I need?

246
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.290
Piyush Garg: Sure.

247
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.370
Piyush Garg: Oh.

248
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:24.140
Piyush Garg: yeah.

249
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.290
Piyush Garg: at least the constructive.

250
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:06.810
Piyush Garg: Okay. So I

251
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:13.540
Piyush Garg: I need to inherit the app comp text view and then set the parameters for this. Okay.

252
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:16.670
Piyush Garg: So let's say we have. Okay.

253
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.300
our tick.

254
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:26.340
Piyush Garg: since we are doing price text view it, it should have a format to show the text in right. So basically.

255
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:36.280
Piyush Garg: if you are showing this cost in us or Canada, you will add the dollar simple in front of your next view, or if you are showing this in.

256
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:48.080
Piyush Garg: I don't know. Uk you'll add a pound signal symbol in front of your text 3. So you can get that from the number format class and

257
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.840
Piyush Garg: in and right. So

258
00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:55.700
Piyush Garg: it's a Java class, I think. So let's have private.

259
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:03.900
Piyush Garg: Okay.

260
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.120
Piyush Garg: number of

261
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:24.590
Piyush Garg: good. How it seems so this is this will get. Does the currency, in instance, for whatever the default local is in your

262
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:28.750
Piyush Garg: if you want the specific local, you can also pass a local view.

263
00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:38.040
Piyush Garg: Okay. So this is a number format, and then let's add a few to this, so we'll have a price field here. Then.

264
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:42.510
Piyush Garg: alright.

265
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.650
Piyush Garg: that can be a float value. So

266
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:47.640
Piyush Garg: 0 point 0 0. If

267
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:53.150
Piyush Garg: and they can change so right

268
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.010
Piyush Garg: right

269
00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:18.270
Piyush Garg: it.

270
00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:28.620
Piyush Garg: Well, you

271
00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.670
it is

272
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:37.160
Piyush Garg: Yeah. what I do.

273
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.900
Piyush Garg: You have to send some text here.

274
00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:43.410
Piyush Garg: Save it next

275
00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.740
it's.

276
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:18.290
Piyush Garg: Can you guys hear me? Is the background noise too much.

277
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.460
You can hear this.

278
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.130
Mithul Koshy: Yeah. Okay.

279
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.420
Piyush Garg: Okay. So

280
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:35.080
Piyush Garg: yeah, we define a element called price

281
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:42.970
Piyush Garg: which would be set as a text view on on the Ui. but it is of type float.

282
00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:47.210
Piyush Garg: Okay. So if I want to use this custom price text view

283
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.790
Piyush Garg: in our application.

284
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:53.770
I go to this layout, which is the main layout and add.

285
00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.000
Piyush Garg: the custom takes to be here now instead of thanks to you.

286
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:14.800
Piyush Garg: Okay, so you can get the price text view instead of text view. because it is the custom layout that we created. Okay.

287
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.580
Piyush Garg: we have a bit of.

288
00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:27.600
Piyush Garg: We can give it the style as well, so we can use the same style. but it's you style. Oh.

289
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.750
Piyush Garg: oh.

290
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:38.270
Piyush Garg: and

291
00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:38.900
I would.

292
00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:48.610
Piyush Garg: What to

293
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:04.760
Piyush Garg: hey? There.

294
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:38.350
Piyush Garg: Okay. So now, instead of using the default, layout

295
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:43.070
or default text view. We are using the text that we created.

296
00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.370
Piyush Garg: Okay. And the last step is to add this

297
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:53.860
Piyush Garg: int0 0ur resources folder. Okay. So we'll add

298
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.890
Piyush Garg: resource, file.

299
00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.100
Piyush Garg: or if it attributes or

300
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:07.070
Piyush Garg: good, I I declare it's time ago.

301
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.440
Piyush Garg: Okay.

302
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.040
Piyush Garg: which, when I

303
00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:33.020
Piyush Garg: attribute or right

304
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:38.410
Piyush Garg: format, would be slow.

305
00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:43.810
Piyush Garg: and it can take value from resources as well. So if it's

306
00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:48.590
Piyush Garg: okay.

307
00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.360
Piyush Garg: I'll have to pay this

308
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.430
Piyush Garg: so that we can visualize you like.

309
00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:48.060
Piyush Garg: Okay, so this is where our price. Text view is now

310
00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:49.740
Piyush Garg: okay. Can you see this?

311
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:55.440
Piyush Garg: All right? Now, if I want to set the price?

312
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:56.720
Piyush Garg: So are you.

313
00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:00.960
Piyush Garg: We can go to the activity and

314
00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:10.910
Piyush Garg: finding Dot price. Thanks to you. right there is. let's say, 200 points

315
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:14.010
Piyush Garg: cool.

316
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:16.810
Piyush Garg: Okay.

317
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.640
And if you run this code

318
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:26.050
Piyush Garg: you will see here that it comes with a dollar symbol dollar, 200.7 5.

319
00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:50.140
Piyush Garg: So i'm giving the constructor to a view.

320
00:58:56.710 --> 00:59:01.750
Piyush Garg: Yeah, you'll just have to give this virtual machine overload

321
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:07.090
Piyush Garg: because we are giving that structure to the custom view. Right?

322
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:24.040
Piyush Garg: Okay. So you can see

323
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:27.940
Piyush Garg: the text to you. Has the dollar symbol in it Right?

324
00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:37.010
Piyush Garg: What? Not always do. We want to set the price programmatically.

325
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:42.180
Piyush Garg: We sometimes want to do in our layout file. We can add

326
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:44.450
Piyush Garg: something like fixed right.

327
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:56.300
Piyush Garg: Exchange whatever right we want to be able to do that with our custom views as well. So here, what we can do is add price

328
00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.370
Piyush Garg: and give it some value.

329
01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.080
Piyush Garg: Okay. But to show this value

330
01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:16.630
Piyush Garg: from your Xml file you will have to edit the code and use these attribute sets instead. Okay.

331
01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:28.140
Piyush Garg: And did you notice we added a style component to this layout as well. so that style competent uses. This defined style attribute

332
01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:30.030
Piyush Garg: to set the layout.

333
01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:34.800
Piyush Garg: so it's in it.

334
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.840
Piyush Garg: No contribute. So

335
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:46.750
Piyush Garg: click. if Attribute said, is not null.

336
01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:51.170
Piyush Garg: then we get well. 5 3,

337
01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:57.970
Piyush Garg: it's

338
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:02.000
Piyush Garg: context, not of you

339
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:05.850
Piyush Garg: styled attribute our toddler bill

340
01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:13.080
Piyush Garg: alright, price next to you. So we get this price text view from our attributes, resources.

341
01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.850
Piyush Garg: and action. The it will be able to value

342
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:19.270
Piyush Garg: int0 0ur text. Okay.

343
01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:21.380
Piyush Garg: So this, then.

344
01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.280
Piyush Garg: right?

345
01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:29.600
Piyush Garg: It's it

346
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.030
Piyush Garg: the solar side

347
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:39.740
Piyush Garg: price.

348
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.820
Piyush Garg: This underscore price is nothing but this value

349
01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.890
Piyush Garg: price text view underscore price.

350
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:53.310
Piyush Garg: Okay. it needs a default value to

351
01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:04.990
Piyush Garg: right.

352
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.720
do we?

353
01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:57.700
Piyush Garg: So

354
01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:11.050
yeah, once you use the type that you need to recycle it.

355
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:27.340
Piyush Garg: So by using this particular piece of code, you will be able to patch in the attribute value price into your text view here.

356
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.340
Piyush Garg: Okay.

357
01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:34.080
Piyush Garg: So using this price value price text view price into

358
01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:36.830
Piyush Garg: this variable price. Okay.

359
01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:39.440
Piyush Garg: it's one discord now.

360
01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:44.040
Piyush Garg: actually enough to to me this out.

361
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:49.850
Piyush Garg: So you

362
01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.610
Piyush Garg: to the default. But

363
01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:28.640
okay.

364
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.420
right.

365
01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:52.160
Piyush Garg: So this

366
01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:24.050
Piyush Garg: okay. So this will help you visualize as well as

367
01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:27.030
show it on your layout.

368
01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.180
Piyush Garg: using the attribute to the click. Okay.

369
01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.310
Piyush Garg: why is that?

370
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:52.050
Piyush Garg: And like different currencies across the world, and different number of patterns have different ways of showing 100,000 right like in India you have. If you have 100,000, there will be spacing of

371
01:06:52.050 --> 01:07:02.690
Piyush Garg: 3 digits, then comma and 2 digits, and then comma, but in us and Canada you'll have 3 digits, 3 digits, and 3 digits, so if I add one more

372
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.020
Piyush Garg: or 2 more digits here.

373
01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:19.090
Piyush Garg: so it uses the default local or the default

374
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:22.840
Piyush Garg: in Egypt

375
01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:25.860
Piyush Garg: to set your textbook right.

376
01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:26.880
Piyush Garg: I need to

377
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:33.720
Piyush Garg: Do you guys have any questions about this?

378
01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:48.790
Piyush Garg: Do you understand how to create a custom view? What a custom takes to you in this case?

379
01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.760
Piyush Garg: Yes.

380
01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:59.670
Vinny Vinu: Professor, Can you explain the permission to like, select the default by doing this

381
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:01.520
Piyush Garg: like this value?

382
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:04.270
Piyush Garg: Okay.

383
01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.670
Vinny Vinu: like you have given a function right?

384
01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.140
Piyush Garg: This is a in it block.

385
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:24.260
Piyush Garg: So whenever you run this class, the first blocks that runs is in it. Okay. So in in it we are checking. If the attribute set that's coming into the construct through the constructor is not null.

386
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.630
Piyush Garg: If it is not no, then we, using the a

387
01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.779
attribute set.

388
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:36.399
Piyush Garg: we obtain the styled attributes from your attribute. Xml file.

389
01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:37.620
Piyush Garg: Okay.

390
01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:40.779
Piyush Garg: And after that

391
01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:46.810
Piyush Garg: you use that typed rate to get each element of that

392
01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:50.000
Piyush Garg: style of built into your port.

393
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:57.960
Piyush Garg: In our case, we only have one attribute. That is the price and soft type floor, so we can

394
01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:01.460
Piyush Garg: directly patch it into the price variable

395
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:04.490
Vinny Vinu: next up.

396
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:05.970
Vinny Vinu: Okay, Thank you.

397
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:07.240
Piyush Garg: Okay.

398
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.649
Vinny Vinu: Thank you.

399
01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.040
Piyush Garg: No problem.

400
01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:23.580
Piyush Garg: So I wanted to see if this it currency.

401
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:04.290
Piyush Garg: not sure if English uses 1 2 3 2 2,

402
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.930
Piyush Garg: But we can definitely see

403
01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.210
Piyush Garg: screen

404
01:10:52.530 --> 01:11:01.870
Piyush Garg: symbols, is not? It's not able to get the pound symbol here. That's why you get to be your box here. But see, change the

405
01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.570
Piyush Garg: fall back right. If you do.

406
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:07.650
Piyush Garg: maybe

407
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.450
Piyush Garg: Chinese it will be able to hit it. But sure, let's see

408
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.510
Piyush Garg: Right? Okay.

409
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:40.470
Piyush Garg: So you'll have to just download those different at different locals to show this correctly. But you can see the symbol is changing here right

410
01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:43.100
Piyush Garg: just by changing that. Look at

411
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:53.900
Piyush Garg: Okay. So the next step we'll do here is to create a layout.

412
01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.160
Piyush Garg: a custom layout. Okay.

413
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:08.080
Piyush Garg: it's make for the costs.

414
01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:14.930
Piyush Garg: Yeah.

415
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:23.680
Piyush Garg: we can have one text view and one edit text

416
01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:25.960
Piyush Garg: in that you

417
01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.300
Piyush Garg: okay for me.

418
01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:33.230
Piyush Garg: Muted. Yeah.

419
01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:45.890
Piyush Garg: Okay. So this form feeding layout will extend a linear layout for us because we want to create a layout

420
01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:49.950
Piyush Garg: that's interesting.

421
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:56.850
Piyush Garg: and that needs context attributes, set

422
01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.530
Piyush Garg: style, attribute and style resource.

423
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:04.640
Piyush Garg: Okay. So then.

424
01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:23.870
Piyush Garg: one thing

425
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.440
Piyush Garg: like a good set.

426
01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:55.330
Piyush Garg: So you.

427
01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.800
Piyush Garg: this will be this.

428
01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:28.750
Piyush Garg: you know, before 2 0.

429
01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:39.910
We save it

430
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.810
Piyush Garg: all right.

431
01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:58.750
Piyush Garg: Okay.

432
01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.850
Piyush Garg: So just like we did for the text to you.

433
01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:05.830
Piyush Garg: we actually lay out here. Okay.

434
01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.330
Piyush Garg: let's create a layout for this.

435
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:24.790
Yeah.

436
01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.870
Piyush Garg: yeah.

437
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:39.130
Piyush Garg: I have one image view and 2 text. Using this.

438
01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.180
Piyush Garg: there will be a time for next few.

439
01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:55.300
Piyush Garg: a bit of

440
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:17.620
Piyush Garg: which you

441
01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:18.120
Piyush Garg: Okay. So I have this view which has one image view and 2 text views. Okay.

442
01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.800
Piyush Garg: and use this as our

443
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:31.410
Piyush Garg: so to do that in our class 5

444
01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.840
Piyush Garg: we'll have to send the in a clock

445
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.740
Piyush Garg: you have to do

446
01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.990
may out in place it

447
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:55.270
Piyush Garg: our dot layout.

448
01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:03.200
Piyush Garg: you know.

449
01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:05.430
Piyush Garg: Yeah.

450
01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:08.980
Piyush Garg: the dealer is

451
01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:11.070
Piyush Garg: nothing.

452
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:17.060
Piyush Garg: Isn't this this itself

453
01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.020
that's the end. True.

454
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:26.900
Piyush Garg: Okay. So if you do this, your layout would be visible.

455
01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:33.360
Piyush Garg: Let's take it one step at a time. So let's just do this and add this layout to

456
01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:38.690
Piyush Garg: We won't. Be able to see. But of course.

457
01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:40.010
Piyush Garg: right.

458
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:51.660
Piyush Garg: Thank you.

459
01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:10.260
Piyush Garg: Okay.

460
01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:31.340
Piyush Garg: So then your last name activity. Let's try and get plates this new custom, way out.

461
01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:36.640
Piyush Garg: Good. So

462
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:42.470
Piyush Garg: let's see it on this board.

463
01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:47.210
Piyush Garg: Sure.

464
01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:10.860
Piyush Garg: you can see the custom layout here. Okay.

465
01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:25.230
Piyush Garg: but we want to patch in all the fields as well. So what we can do is the the same as what we did for the text view. But we'll have to do for each view. Now. Okay.

466
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:26.450
Piyush Garg: So

467
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:40.080
Piyush Garg: we need to be able to. Okay.

468
01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:44.780
Piyush Garg: Okay, so

469
01:24:46.090 --> 01:24:46.740
Piyush Garg: absolutely

470
01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.190
Piyush Garg: that's

471
01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:10.760
Piyush Garg: you

472
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:18.410
with you.

473
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:26.290
Piyush Garg: Alright.

474
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:40.840
Piyush Garg: so

475
01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:44.580
Piyush Garg: image view is

476
01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.480
Piyush Garg: Id

477
01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.500
Piyush Garg: I will you this fine

478
01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.820
Piyush Garg: you by the right. No

479
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:04.520
Piyush Garg: description of you.

480
01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:11.950
Piyush Garg: Okay.

481
01:26:13.150 --> 01:26:18.180
Piyush Garg: And up to this we'll populate the values into these.

482
01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:23.660
Piyush Garg: So let's have 3 variables

483
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:26.600
Piyush Garg: image.

484
01:26:27.150 --> 01:26:28.990
Piyush Garg: Well, I

485
01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.290
Piyush Garg: Oh, something

486
01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.370
that's

487
01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.450
Piyush Garg: so. If there is a

488
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:20.040
Piyush Garg: we can calculate the emails and do this.

489
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:24.320
it.

490
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:26.880
Piyush Garg: you know it.

491
01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:37.700
Piyush Garg: So whatever image I pass, or whatever whatever resource Id that I pass to the image.

492
01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:46.380
Piyush Garg: we'll send that value to this image, and if the value is not null. Then we'll also set the image view

493
01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:48.870
Piyush Garg: with that driver. P.

494
01:27:49.660 --> 01:27:54.360
Piyush Garg: For the other 2. These are text to you, and would be same as the price text. You.

495
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:19.270
Piyush Garg: Okay.

496
01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:21.440
Piyush Garg: Thanks.

497
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.940
Yeah.

498
01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:24.180
Piyush Garg: Bye.

499
01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:26.900
Piyush Garg: Okay.

500
01:28:28.450 --> 01:28:30.100
Piyush Garg: Okay. So it's true.

501
01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.720
Piyush Garg: Again, the

502
01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:40.130
Piyush Garg: in the description of I screen

503
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.810
Piyush Garg: it. It's this.

504
01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.480
Piyush Garg: So well, you

505
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:52.330
Piyush Garg: we have to

506
01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:55.830
Piyush Garg: this.

507
01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:05.690
Piyush Garg: So we just need to patch in the values from the attribute

508
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:07.820
Piyush Garg: set into these

509
01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:09.320
video books. Now.

510
01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:15.040
Piyush Garg: so to do that we'll go back t0 0ur it.

511
01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:25.570
Piyush Garg: Yeah.

512
01:29:35.150 --> 01:29:37.940
Piyush Garg: for that is reference.

513
01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:54.970
Piyush Garg: Okay. the famous on straight.

514
01:29:58.780 --> 01:29:59.760
Piyush Garg: Okay.

515
01:30:07.930 --> 01:30:08.670
Piyush Garg: It's a.

516
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:26.030
Piyush Garg: Because

517
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:44.160
Piyush Garg: Oh, I I

518
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:27.860
Piyush Garg: Okay. Yeah, okay.

519
01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:40.130
Piyush Garg: We'll have to set default values for these. So

520
01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.140
Piyush Garg: right.

521
01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.320
Piyush Garg: this set of the value for title

522
01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:32.400
Piyush Garg: description.

523
01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.440
Piyush Garg: Okay.

524
01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:18.730
right? And the

525
01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:19.750
Piyush Garg: so

526
01:33:27.570 --> 01:33:30.010
Piyush Garg: it's our sighting here on top.

527
01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.010
Piyush Garg: Okay. image

528
01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:41.200
Piyush Garg: and default. Let's keep it to minus one, so that we can check If

529
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:45.080
Piyush Garg: image. of course.

530
01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.490
Piyush Garg: is greater than 0.

531
01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:50.230
Piyush Garg: There you

532
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:57.100
Piyush Garg: zoom. You can see

533
01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:01.620
Piyush Garg: the

534
01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:02.560
it's.

535
01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:05.210
Piyush Garg: It's so

536
01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:17.490
Piyush Garg: okay. So this sets up our entire Leo.

537
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:22.020
Piyush Garg: and again going to the Xml file. We can, I,

538
01:34:48.610 --> 01:34:49.810
Piyush Garg: and use this

539
01:35:15.570 --> 01:35:16.690
Piyush Garg: before.

540
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:35.030
Piyush Garg: Yes.

541
01:36:10.210 --> 01:36:13.660
Piyush Garg: Okay. So it's loading the image correctly.

542
01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:17.880
Piyush Garg: It's too

543
01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.580
Piyush Garg: resources

544
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:27.250
Piyush Garg: fixed.

545
01:37:07.290 --> 01:37:07.980
Piyush Garg: Okay.

546
01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.180
Piyush Garg: Okay.

547
01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.450
Piyush Garg: that's the value description.

548
01:39:58.990 --> 01:40:00.550
Piyush Garg: I think that should be it.

549
01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:47.490
Piyush Garg: So. Maybe it's not able to get this resource file directly. Let's move this

550
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:50.800
Piyush Garg: these 2 int0 0ur string files.

551
01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:54.400
Piyush Garg: Yes. So I

552
01:40:57.910 --> 01:41:00.400
Piyush Garg: It is this.

553
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.630
Yeah.

554
01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:16.990
Piyush Garg: it's.

555
01:42:56.350 --> 01:43:00.110
Piyush Garg: Yes, in any case this is how you would use it.

556
01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:01.280
Piyush Garg: Okay.

557
01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:08.430
Piyush Garg: let's just quickly add binding instead of using the layout and creators.

558
01:43:09.330 --> 01:43:12.740
Piyush Garg: So i'll have to by way.

559
01:43:19.890 --> 01:43:21.840
Piyush Garg: find it of time.

560
01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:24.690
you know.

561
01:43:25.190 --> 01:43:26.740
Piyush Garg: Okay, now.

562
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:31.530
Piyush Garg: So

563
01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:40.890
I need

564
01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:52.590
Piyush Garg: right.

565
01:44:21.690 --> 01:44:26.960
Piyush Garg: And the binding is not working now. Great? Okay?

566
01:44:42.490 --> 01:44:43.930
Piyush Garg: And yes.

567
01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:54.820
Piyush Garg: bye.

568
01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:18.210
Piyush Garg: we'll just take 5 more minutes. Okay.

569
01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.660
Piyush Garg: Okay.

570
01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:04.710
Piyush Garg: one takes

571
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:14.810
Piyush Garg: It's it's

572
01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:20.050
Piyush Garg: either.

573
01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:50.730
Piyush Garg: So we are now using binding instead of the layouts and find view by

574
01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.700
Piyush Garg: it, is the issue.

575
01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:07.040
Piyush Garg: Yeah, okay.

576
01:47:07.690 --> 01:47:11.770
Piyush Garg: that's for the binding, which we did not do into it here.

577
01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:41.840
Piyush Garg: Okay.

578
01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:52.810
Piyush Garg: So that's it. That's how to create custom layouts. Okay, just these 2 fields are not populating and check. Why, that is, and let you know in the next class. Okay.

579
01:47:55.540 --> 01:47:57.040
Piyush Garg: Do you have any questions.

580
01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.920
Piyush Garg: Charlie? You were saying something about later in.

581
01:48:23.890 --> 01:48:24.570
Piyush Garg: Hello.

582
01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:29.950
Piyush Garg: Okay.

583
01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:37.810
Piyush Garg: the in that case I'm going to stop recording the lecture, and i'll see you on. Is it first or second March?

584
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.430
Piyush Garg: 0 20, seventh, February. Okay.

585
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:46.600
Piyush Garg: I'll see you all on 20 seventh February. Okay.
